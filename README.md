# ADVi3++ Personal Branch

This is my personal branch of ADVi3++. I keep this so I can save changes and keep my version up to date.

# Printer

My printer is a Microcenter PowerSpec WanHao Duplicator I3 PLUS. The printable mods I use can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/hingino/collections/i3-plus-upgrades "Thingiverse Collection").

I have recently upgraded my extruder to an E3D Hemera. The necessary updates for this upgrade have been made to the Marlin firmare by following the guide [here](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/01+-+E3D+Hemera+Marlin+firmware+modification+(Direct)/129?lang=en)
